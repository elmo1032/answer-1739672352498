It seems like you're asking about a "sum function." In programming and mathematics, a sum function typically refers to a function that calculates the total of a set of numbers. The specific implementation can vary depending on the programming language or context. Here are a few examples in different programming languages:

### Python
In Python, you can use the built-in `sum()` function to calculate the sum of a list or any iterable:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
total = sum(numbers)
print(total)  # Output: 15
```

### JavaScript
In JavaScript, you can create a function to sum an array of numbers:

```javascript
function sum(arr) {
    return arr.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const total = sum(numbers);
console.log(total);  // Output: 15
```

### Java
In Java, you can use a loop or streams to sum an array of integers:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int total = Arrays.stream(numbers).sum();
        System.out.println(total);  // Output: 15
    }
}
```

### Excel
In Excel, you can use the `SUM` function to add up a range of cells:

```
=SUM(A1:A5)
```

This will sum all the values from cells A1 to A5.

If you have a specific context or programming language in mind, please provide more details, and I can give you a more tailored response!
